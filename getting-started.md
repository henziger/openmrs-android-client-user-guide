### Use Case - Patient Registration

After having successfully logged in, you may perform different activities. For instance, if you wish to register a new patient, click the "Register Patient" icon. You will be presented with a form in which you fill in the patient's information. When you have entered all the required information, press the "Register Patient" button at the end of the form. If the registration was successful, you will be presented with the patient's summary view from which you can access his/her visits and vitals information etc.
